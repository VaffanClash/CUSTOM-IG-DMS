# CUSTOM IG DMS
Ever noticed how bad Instagram DM's style is? Try to shrink the page a bit; What happens?  
Exactly, all you can see is the side bar, and you can't read messages at all.  Well, let's fix it!

### What does this extension do?
Now, if the page is not wide enough for messages to be read confortably, the extension will automatically set the page to fullscreen.  
You can also use the button in the top right corner to go back!

Keep in mind that you have to resize the page in order for it to detect the width, so if the extension is injected when the page is already too small, you will not be able to read the messages. To fix that, just resize the page, even by a single pixel!
